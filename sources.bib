	abstract = { Abstract The method of measuring atmospheric temperature profiles with differential absorption lidar ({DIAL}), based on the temperature dependence of oxygen absorption lines in the near infrared, is investigated in some detail. Particularly the influence of Doppler broadening on the Rayleigh-backscattered signal is evaluated, and a correction method for this effect is presented. This correction, however, requires an accurate estimate of the molecular- and particle backscatter contributions, which is hardly achievable by usual lidar inversion techniques. Under realistic conditions, resulting errors may be as high as 10 K. First range-resolved measurements using this technique are presented, using a slightly modified DIAL system originally constructed for water vapor measurements. Temperature profiles in the planetary boundary layer are obtained with a resolution of 82 m vertical and 30 min in time, showing an absolute accuracy of 4 K and an error in the temperature gradient of 0.5 K (100 m)−1. While much better resolution can certainly be achieved by technical improvements, the errors introduced by the uncertainty of the backscatter contributions will remain and determine the accuracy that can be obtained with this method. }

	abstract = { Abstract A differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument for automated profiling of water vapor in the lower troposphere has been designed, tested, and is in routine operation at Montana State University. The laser transmitter for the DIAL instrument uses a widely tunable external cavity diode laser (ECDL) to injection seed two cascaded semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) to produce a laser transmitter that accesses the 824–841-nm spectral range. The DIAL receiver utilizes a 28-cm-diameter Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope; an avalanche photodiode (APD) detector; and a narrowband optical filter to collect, discriminate, and measure the scattered light. A technique of correcting for the wavelength-dependent incident angle upon the narrowband optical filter as a function of range has been developed to allow accurate water vapor profiles to be measured down to 225 m above the surface. Data comparisons using the DIAL instrument and collocated radiosonde measurements are presented demonstrating the capabilities of the DIAL instrument. }

    abstract = { Abstract The theory of differential absorption lidar measurements for lines with a Voigt profile is given and applied to a two-wavelength technique for measuring the atmospheric temperature profile using a high J line in the oxygen A band. Explicit expressions for the temperature and pressure dependence of the absorption coefficient are developed for lines with a Voigt profile. An iteration procedure for calculating the temperature for narrow laser bandwidths is described which has an accuracy better than 0.2 K for bandwidths < 0.01 cm−1. To reduce the errors in lidar measurements due to uncertainties in pressure, we describe a method for estimating the pressure from the temperature profile. We also describe a procedure for extending the differential absorption technique to the case of finite laser bandwidth with good accuracy. Simulation results show that a knowledge of the laser frequency is needed to 0.005 cm−1 for accurate temperature measurements. Evaluation of the sensitivity for both ground- and Shuttle-based measurements shows accuracies generally better than 1 K. This technique allows up to an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to other differential absorption lidar techniques. }

abstract = {A comprehensive formulation of the differential absorption lidar(DIAL) methodology is presented that explicitly includes details ofthe spectral distributions of both the transmitted and thebackscattered light. The method is important for high-accuracywater-vapor retrievals and in particular for temperaturemeasurements. Probability estimates of the error that is due toDoppler-broadened Rayleigh scattering based on an extended experimentaldata set are presented, as is an analytical treatment of errors thatare due to averaging in the nonlinear retrieval scheme. Systemperformance requirements are derived that show that water-vaporretrievals with an accuracy of better than 5\% and temperatureretrievals with an accuracy of better than 1 K in the entiretroposphere are feasible if the error that results fromRayleigh--Doppler correction can be avoided. A modification of theDIAL technique, high-spectral-resolution DIAL avoids errors that aredue to Doppler-broadened Rayleigh backscatter and permits simultaneouswater-vapor and wind measurements with the same system.},

It is capable of performing calibrated retrievals of aerosol and cloud optical properties at a 150 m range resolution with less than 1 minute integration time over an approximate range of 12 km during day and night. This instrument operates at 780 nm, a wavelength that is well established for reliable semiconductor lasers and detectors, and was chosen because it corresponds to the D2 rubidium absorption line. A heated vapor reference cell of isotopic rubidium 87 is used as an effective and reliable aerosol signal blocking filter in the instrument. In principle, the diode-laser-based high spectral resolution lidar can be made cost competitive with elastic backscatter lidar systems, yet delivers a significant improvement in data quality through direct retrieval of quantitative optical properties of clouds and aerosols.},
